# Dinner Pickers

A website designed to help Becca and Luke decide what recipes to cook from their several cook books

## Description

We've gotten several cook books and every time we try to choose something from it we just leave the book alone. This website should force us to pick something and try it, even if we don't like it. 

Theres potential this website could become something more, Maybe me and Beccas main website where we have shared photos and everything but for now just going to use it to choose our dinner recipes.
